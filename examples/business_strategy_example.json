  "query": "Should company X expand into Southeast Asian markets in 2026? Consider regulatory risks, key competitors, and infrastructure requirements.",
  "executive_summary": "Expansion into Southeast Asian (SEA) markets in 2026 presents a high-growth opportunity tempered by significant regulatory fragmentation and infrastructure gaps. While Vietnam and Indonesia offer robust digital economy growth, competition from regional incumbents like GoTo and Sea Group remains intense. A phased entry focusing on cloud infrastructure hubs is recommended.",
  "report": "# Expansion Strategy: Southeast Asian Market Entry 2026\n\n## Market Overview\nThe SEA region continues to show a 15% CAGR in digital services, with Vietnam and Indonesia leading the growth. By 2026, the middle-class population is expected to reach 350 million.\n\n## Regulatory Landscape\nRegulatory risks are high due to varying data residency laws (e.g., Indonesia's GR 71) and complex licensing for fintech services. Navigating these requires local joint ventures.\n\n## Competition\nLocal giants like Shopee and Grab have deep penetration. New entrants should focus on niche B2B industrial tech rather than broad B2C retail.\n\n## Infrastructure\nLogistics infrastructure is improving but remains a hurdle in archipelagic nations like the Philippines. Cloud availability through AWS and Google Cloud hubs in Singapore and Indonesia provides a solid foundation for digital services.",

    "Indonesia and Vietnam are the highest growth priority markets.",
    "Data residency compliance is the primary regulatory hurdle.",
    "Strategic partnership with local incumbents is more viable than direct competition."
